Note: This guide starts on the beach of the Mainland south of the stream.
1. Face and travel east at 90 degrees until you reach the eastern map border of the mainland.
2. Turn and travel south to the southern border which is a travelpoint.
3. Press shift enter and exit the mainland south into the shallow ocean. Continue through the shallow ocean south and also exit it south via the travel point and enter the deep ocean.
4. Walk south until you reach the deep deep ocean. You will be told "you cannot travel here without a boat". Do not paddle south, it is not required for this path.
5. Side-step to your left(east) until you reach the travelpoint. Press shift enter and exit the ocean east and enter the mining area.
6. Once in the Mining Area take a step or two to your left(east) so you are not on the travel point.
7. Travel all the way south through the Mining Area until you reach the travelpoint on the map's southern border.
8. Press shift enter and exit the mining area south into an ocean.
9. Take two steps forward(south) then side step to your right(west) until you reach the travelpoint that is labled "to continue into the old city, press shift enter".
10. Press shift enter to leave the ocean west and you are now in the Irradiated City.
11. Travel all the way south at 180 through the Iradiated City. When you reach the southern map border do not exit the city south.
12. Once you reach the southern map border turn and travel west at 270 until you reach the western map border of the city.
13. Once at the western border back up one step(east) so you are not on the travelpoint to exit the city west.
14. Turn and face south at 180 then exit the city south at this point into another ocean.
	
	Note: You will lose a small amount of health in the city every few seconds. You can avoid this by traveling in the ocean to the east, and then in the ocean south. The problem with this is you cannot bike in the shallow part of the ocean. If you choose to walk in the ocean instead just make sure you enter back into the city and exit the city south, then continue west to the western map border of the ocean. Overall the health loss is very small and it is nothing to worry about.
	
15. Take a few steps south after exiting the city until you reach the deep part of the ocean. Paddle all the way south across this ocean.
16. When you cross the ocean walk through the shallow water on it's southern border and exit the ocean south into the marsh.
17. Enter the Southern Marsh and take two steps forward(south). Then step to your right(west) until you are at the travelpoint to leave the marsh west.
18. Press shift enter and exit the marsh west. Run to your right(west) until you are at the deep part of the ocean.
19. Turn and face west at 270 and paddle all the way across this ocean west until you reach the shallow water on the western map border.
20. Walk in the shallow water west until you reach the travelpoint to exit the ocean and enter into the Battle Marked & Destroyed Forest.
21. Press shift enter on the travelpoint and you will be on the Battle Marked Forest and your PK will be automatically enabled.
