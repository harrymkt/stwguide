# Arid Grassland:

Note: This guide starts on the Mainland southwest of where the river bends and flows west.

1. On the mainland, travel north at 0 degrees until you reach the northern map border, which is a travel point to the Desert.

2. Do not enter the desert. Instead, turn and travel west at 270 degrees until you reach the western map border.

3. Once you reach the western map border, turn and face north at 0 degrees again.

4. Travel into the desert and run forward 30 or 35 steps until you reach the travel point to leave the desert to the west. Press Shift+Enter to leave the desert map.

5. Travel west at 270 degrees until you completely cross the wasteland.

6. On the western border of the wasteland, use the travel point to exit the map to the west.

7. You are now in the pine forest. Continue to travel west at 270 degrees until you reach the stream that flows north and south.

Note: Don't go in the stream yet. Stay on the eastern side of the stream in the mud.


8. Once you reach the stream, turn and travel north at 0 degrees. Follow the stream until you reach the northern map border.

9. Once you hit the border, side-step to your left (west) until you are on the travel point located in the river.

10. Press Shift+Enter and leave the pine forest to the north. You are now in the stream in the Arid Grassland.
