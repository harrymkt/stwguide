Note: The East bay maps are an extension of the tranquil coastal beaches, but where the beach travels west, then north, ,then back east before continuing north. This makes a large square shaped bay which is connected to the great eastern ocean to the east. It is the same beach you were traveling on before, but broken down into the east bay group because of the bay it makes.
