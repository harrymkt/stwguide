pm from ijlal. Hello.
This is a guide for the quest foreman's treasure written by Ikram and mee (Kassandra) hopefully it can help you finish the quest.
Feel free to share the guide with other players.
If you need help at some point in the quest, or if there's wrong info in the guide / it's hard to understand, PM me in game and I'll try to help. My character names are Kassandra and IronMan
Note: This guide was written by me and Ikram, and English isn't our native language so sorry if some parts of the guide are hard to understand, We did our best to make it easy to understand.
Credits:

Thanks Arman, Edward and Morteza for helping me through some parts that I was stuck on.
