<h1 >Contributing to the documentation</h1>
<p>This is the help file to let you know how you could contribute to stw's documentation. To contribute, you will need to understand how the documentation is processed in order to ensure readability, stability, and accuracy.</p>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>All of the documentation is written using a special syntax called <b>Markdown</b>(.md extention). These Markdown files are then converted into a readable HTML format for display in the browser.

<h2>folder and file structure</h2>
<p>each document is created in each folder. for example, a folder for <b>camera</b>. in the folder, we'll next create index.md. index.md is necessary in each folders you create.</p>

<h2>start</h2>
<p>make sure to clone the repository on your local device.</p>
<p>first of all, look in the docs folders to know how the directories are structured. only then will you be able to design your documents.</p>
<p>next, create your document files with <b>.md</b> extention.</p>
<h3>title</h3>
<p>the title of the document is used by a first level heading at the top of the file.</p>
<pre>
# this is the title
</pre>
<br>
<p>the title is simply a first level heading. the top first level heading will be rendered as title of the document.</p>

<h3>heading</h3>
<p>headings are a way to help organize your documentation for readability. a heading is used by a hash character followed by a space(<code>#</code>). the hash character can be added depending on which level of the heading you want. there are 6 available levels. example</p>
<pre>
# heading 1
## heading level 2.
#### heading level4.
</pre>
<br>
<p>as you can see, the heading helps organizing your documentation, also offering accessibility for the visually impaired or using keyboard shortcuts.</p>

<h3>code</h3>
<p>a code is a block that highlights the code syntax, probably used to show a simple codes. a code is used by grave character (<code>`</code>). the grave character is located to the left of number 1 in most keyboards.</p>
<p>example</p>
<pre>
# title test

use the command `/help` to game help menu

</pre>
<br>
<p>as you can see, the <code>/help</code> is highlighted as a code</p>

<h3>code block, multi</h3>
<p>sometimes, you may want to show a block of codes with multiple lines. as such time, you can use the syntax below.</p>
<p>the code block is seperated by 3 backticks (<code>```</code>). you may also need to close again. consider the following example</p><br>
<pre>
# title test

declare y and assign 3-1 to it.

```
y=0
y=3-1;
print(y)
```
</pre>
<p>you can also add the language name after opening the backticks.</p>
<br>
<pre>
# title test

declare x and add 3+2 in python.

```python
x=3+2
print(x)
```
</pre>
<h3>Paragraph</h3>
<p>a paragraph is used by adding 1 line break. consider the following example</p>

<pre>
this is the first paragraph

this is another paragraph
</pre>
<br>

<h3>links</h3>
<p>you can add links to files or external URLS by surrounding text with left and right bracket, and link with params. consider the following example</p>
<br>
<pre>
[go to website](https://website.com)

[go to file](file.extention)

[go to the file that is 1 directory upward](../file.extention)

[go to the file from root](/file.extention)

</pre>
