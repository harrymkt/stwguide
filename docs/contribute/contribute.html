<h1>Survive The Wild (STW) Contribution Guidelines</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Survive The Wild (STW) documentation project! We're excited to have you contribute to enhancing the documentation for this game developed by Sam Tupy. Your contributions will help players navigate quests, map directions, item crafting, and more effectively. Below are guidelines for contributing using GitHub Desktop and an alternative method via Telegram.</p>

<h2>How to Contribute Using GitHub Desktop</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Fork the Documentation Repository</strong><br>
Start by forking the documentation repository of STW to your GitHub account. This will create a personal copy where you can make changes.</li>

<li><strong>Clone the Repository with GitHub Desktop</strong><br>
Open GitHub Desktop. Click on "File" in the menu and select "Clone repository." Choose the "URL" tab and paste the URL of your forked repository (<code>https://github.com/your-username/stwguide.git</code>). Select a local path where you want to clone the repository. Click on "Clone" to download the repository to your local machine.</li>

<li><strong>Make Changes Locally</strong><br>
Open the cloned repository in your preferred text editor. Navigate to the section you'd like to contribute to, such as quests, map directions, or item crafting. Edit the Markdown files to make your changes. Ensure that your edits are clear, concise, and follow the established style and formatting guidelines.</li>

<li><strong>Commit Changes with GitHub Desktop</strong><br>
Switch back to GitHub Desktop. You should see the changes you made listed under "Changes" tab. Write a brief summary of your changes in the "Summary" field. Optionally, provide a more detailed description in the "Description" field. Click on "Commit to main" to commit your changes locally.</li>

<li><strong>Push Changes to Your Fork</strong><br>
After committing your changes, click on "Push origin" to push your commits to your forked repository on GitHub.</li>

<li><strong>Create a Pull Request</strong><br>
Visit your forked repository on GitHub. You should see a banner indicating that you've recently pushed a new branch. Click on the "Compare & pull request" button. Review your changes and ensure everything looks good. Provide a descriptive title and detailed description for your pull request. Click on "Create pull request" to submit your changes for review.</li>

<li><strong>Review and Iterate</strong><br>
Collaborate with maintainers and other contributors to review your pull request. Address any feedback or requested changes by making additional commits to your branch.</li>

<li><strong>Merge Your Pull Request</strong><br>
Once your pull request has been approved, a maintainer will merge it into the main branch of the documentation repository. Congratulations on your contribution!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Alternative Contribution Method via Telegram</h2>
